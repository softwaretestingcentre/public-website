title: "Observations from 3 decades in QA"

I've been in QA for nearly 30 years, starting with manually checking the output of mainframe routines, through the rise of automation, the arrival of Agile and all the no-QA, no-code, AI fads along the way.
What hasn't happened is an increase in either the quality of software or the efficiency of the development process. 
Despite the advances in hardware and tooling, attitudes to software development are not moving quickly. 
The organisation of software production is subject to outdated ideas. Problems we thought we had solved in the late 90s and early 2000s are still around, preventing us from having full confidence in our capacity to innovate.

By providing some real-world observations and lessons at Software Testing Centre, I hope to start putting this right.
